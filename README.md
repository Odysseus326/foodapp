RECIPE SEARCH SITE, FIND IT [HERE](https://odysseus326.github.io/foodapp/)!
===========================================================================

<p>NOTE: THIS SITE OPERATES WITH A LIMITED NUMBER OF API CALLS PER DAY AND SHOULD RESET AT 4:00PM PST</p>

<p>This website can be used to find interesting recipes.</p>

<p>It utilizes a search bar that can help you find unqiue recipes for common dishes, like pizza or pasta.</p>

<p>It also features a detailed grocery list of items needed to make the recipes, as well as certain facts about the dish (vegan, servings, etc.).</p>

<h2>HOW IT WAS MADE</h2>
<p>This website was built using the React framework, along with the JavaScript, HTML, and CSS languages. </p>

<p>It also benefitted from the <a href="https://spoonacular.com/food-api">Spoonacular API</a>.</p>

<p>This completed project mostly serves as a portfolio piece, although Evan and his partner, along with his roommates will make dishes found here.</p>
